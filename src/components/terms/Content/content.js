        </p>
        <h2>6. Market Making </h2>
        <p>
          6.1. The Client is specifically made aware that in certain markets,
          including the foreign exchange markets, OTC foreign exchange options
          and CFD Contracts, the Execution Venue may act as a Market Maker.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.2. The Company follows the STP execution model with all orders sent
          to JayTradz.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          6.3. The Company will, upon the Client’s written request, in general
          disclose to the Client whether the Company may act as a Market Maker
          in certain CFD Contracts.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          6.4. When acting as a Market Maker, the Execution Venue will under
          normal market circumstances quote the Client bid and ask prices.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          6.5. In order for the Company to quote prices with the swiftness
          normally associated with speculative trading, the Company may have to
          rely on available price or available information that may later prove
          to be faulty due to specific market circumstances, for instance, but
          not limited to, lack of liquidity in or suspension of an asset or
          errors in feeds from information providers or quotes from
          Counter-parties. If so and if the Company has acted in good faith when
          providing the price to the Client, the Company may cancel the trade
          with the Client but shall do so within reasonable time and shall
          provide the Client with a full explanation for the reason for such
          cancellation.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          6.6. Following execution of any position with a Client, the Execution
          Venue may at its reasonable discretion subsequently offset each such
          client position with another Client position, or a position with one
          of the Execution Venue’s Counter-parties or retain a proprietary
          position in the market with the intention to obtain trading profits
          from such positions. Such decisions and actions may therefore result
          in the Execution Venue offsetting client positions at prices different
          – sometimes significantly different – from prices quoted to Clients,
          resulting in trading profits or losses for the Execution Venue. This
          in turn can raise the possibility of the Client incurring what may be
          seen as an implied cost (i.e. the difference between the price at
          which the Client traded with the Execution Venue and the price at
          which the Execution Venue subsequently traded with Counter-parties
          and/ or other Clients) due to any profits realized by the Execution
          Venue as a result of the Market Making function. However the Market
          Making function may involve significant costs to the Execution Venue
          if the market moves against it as compared to the price at which it
          traded with the Client.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          6.8. The Client accepts that the Execution Venue in CFD contracts
          where it acts as Market Maker may hold positions that are contrary to
          positions of the Client, resulting in potential conflicts of interest
          between the Execution Venue and the Client.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          6.9. In markets, where the Execution Venue acts as a Market Maker, the
          Client accepts that the Company has no obligation to quote prices to
          clients at all times in any given market, nor to quote such prices to
          clients with a specific maximum spread.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          6.10. The Client acknowledges, recognizes and accepts that the price
          quoted to the Client includes a spread when compared with the price to
          which the Execution Venue may have covered or expected to be able to
          cover the Contract in a trade with another client or a Counterparty.
          Furthermore, the Client acknowledges, recognizes and accepts that said
          spread constitutes remuneration to the Company and that such spread
          can not necessarily be calculated for all Contracts and that such
          spread will not be specified at the Trade Confirmation or otherwise
          revealed to the Client.
        </p>
        <p>
          {" "}
          6.11. Any commission costs, interest charges, costs associated to and
          included in the spreads quoted by the Execution Venue as a Market
          Maker in certain markets and other fees and charges will consequently
          influence the Client’s trading result and will have a negative effect
          on the Client’s trading performance compared to a situation if such
          commission costs, interest charges, costs associated to and included
          in the spreads did not apply.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          a. In the case that the client account equity is equal or exceeds
          300,000 USD (or currency equivalent) and there are open trades of 50
          lots or more, the Company reserves the right to adjust the leverage of
          the underlying trading account to 1:75. If this is the case the

        <p>
          b. If the Client is an active trader and is undertaking numerous
          transactions, the total impact of visible as well as not visible costs
          may be significant. Consequently the Client may have to obtain
          significant profits in the markets in order to cover the costs
          associated with trading activities with the Execution Venue. For very
          active Clients, such costs may over time exceed the value of the
          margin deposited. Normally, when trading margined derivatives, the
          lower the percentage of the applicable margin rate, the higher the
          proportion of the costs associated with executing a transaction.
          Margined derivatives are derivatives such as CFD’s that can be traded
          using a leverage of higher than 1:1.{" "}

        <p>
          6.12. The Client is specifically made aware that in the area of market
          making in foreign exchange, OTC foreign exchange options, CFD
          Contracts and other OTC products, significant implied costs can arise
          as a consequence of the profits made by the Execution Venue performing
          in its capacity as a Market Maker.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          6.13. The Execution Venue’s performance as a Market Maker may
          negatively affect the Client’s Account with the Execution Venue and
          the said implied costs are neither directly visible nor directly
          quantifiable for the Client at any time.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          6.14. The Execution Venue is at no time obliged to disclose any
          details of its performance or income produced as a Market Maker or
          otherwise related to other commissions, charges and fees.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          6.15. The Client is specifically made aware that CFD Contracts may be
          OTC products quoted by the Execution Venue whilst operating as a
          Market Maker and not traded on a recognized stock exchange. As a
          result, the description above of the implied, not visible costs
          related to the Execution Venue performance as a Market Maker may also
          apply to any CFD Contract.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          6.16. Due to low liquidity and/or or high volatility and widened
          spreads, placing of pending orders around some Economic Announcements
          may be restricted.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          6.17. The Company reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to
          delete any Pending Orders older than three (3) months from the
          Clients’ trading account(s). Pending Order is a “Buy Limit”, “Buy
          Stop”, “Sell Limit” or “Sell Stop” order, as per the Company’s Order
          Execution Policy. Note: All Pending Orders on Shares CFDs and
          Commodities CFDs will be automatically closed during market breaks. In
          case any orders on the aforementioned assets are left pending, they
          will be automatically deleted after the daily market closure time.{" "}
